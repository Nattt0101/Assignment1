<h1>BIGBANG(빅뱅)</h1>

<p>My project is to create a website for the band BIGBANG. This website contains a home page where there'll be the bands most popular albums displayed through carousell. In the homepage, there will be links to the other pages of the website which can be found in the navigation bar. The navigation bar consists of the band logo, home, tour, shop and discography</p>
<p>The aim of this website is for fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history to have an easily navigatable, accessible and detailed website that provides them with trustable information and reliable infomation on the band.</p>
<p>The website also provides them with a trustable official shop for fans to buy merch without worrying about the merch being not authentic. By having a shop in the website, the chances of fans clicking onto the link and looking at the items sold is higher, hence increases the chances of fans buying merch and albums. Since the website is official, fans can buy merch and albums without worrying about being scammed. This encourages fans to buy merch.</p>

<p>With the tour link in the navigation bar, fans can check the official tour dates and buy tickets on the spot. This makes buying tickets for tours so much easier, thus increases the chances of tickets getting soldout. There is also a link that provides methods for organisers to contact and book the band for shows below.</p>

<h1>who this website is for</h1>

<p>This website is for organisers,the band itself, fans and potential fans to use for their own individual purposes such as for learning more about the band, selling merch, tour tickets and albums and booking the band for shows.This project is the best way for them to achieve these things as it is reliable and provides all the information they require in one simple and easy to navigate website. </p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>

<p>As a fan, I want to be able to read up on all the information of my idol and look at pics of him from his different album photoshoots, so that I can appreciate him more.</p>
<p>This link below displays a group pic of the band first, then individual pictures below. The individual pictures of the band members have links that link them to the members own individual profile page where the fans can learn more about the member they selected: </p>

<p>This is the link to the individual profile of each band member, there is going to be a picture of the member on the left. Then, there would be information about the artist on the right, including details about his age, birthday, sign, height etc. There would also be albums that they made on their own displayed below: </p>

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
