<h1>BIGBANG(빅뱅)</h1>

<p>My project is to create a fan website for the band BIGBANG. This website contains a home page where there'll be the bands most popular albums displayed through a carousell. In the homepage, there will be links to the other pages of the website which can be found in the navigation bar. The navigation bar consists of the band logo, home, tour, shop and discography. There is a second nav bar below which provides the links of the bands instagram, youtube, twitter and facebook below through small icons.</p>

<p>The aim of this website is for fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history to have an easily navigatable, accessible and detailed website that provides them with trustable and reliable infomation on the band.</p>

<p>The website also provides them with a trustable information about the band where fans and potential fans can read up without worrying about the information being not fake. By having a discography in the website, the chances of fans clicking onto the link and looking at the albums is very higher, hence increases the chances of fans gaining interest in buying the albums as the album profile has very detailed information about the album such as youtube videos of the mv, teaser, live concet and even lyric videos. Since the website is an official fan site, fans can buy albums without worrying about not knowing what to expect inside as the fan website provides a lot of details. This encourages fans to purchase and spend.</p>

<p>With the tour link in the navigation bar, fans can check the official tour dates and schedule. This makes looking at the bands past tours much easier. There is also a form that enables fans to send messages to their idols, which gives fans a special connection to them. Organisers can also easily send booking requests to the band, thus increases the chances of the band being booked.</p>

<h1>who this website is for</h1>

<p>This website is for organisers,the band itself, fans and potential fans to use for their own individual purposes such as for learning more about the band, selling tour tickets and albums and booking the band for shows.This project is the best way for them to achieve these things as it is reliable and provides all the information they require in one simple and easy to navigate website. </p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>

<p>As a fan, I want to be able to read up on all the information of my idol and look at his solo albums, so that I can appreciate him more.</p>

<p>This link below displays a group pic of the band first, then individual pictures below. The individual pictures of the band members have links that link them to the members own individual profile page where the fans can learn more about the member they selected: </p>
<a href="profile.html">

<p>This is the link to the individual profile of each band member , there is going to be a picture of the member on top with their name beside. Then, there would a be information about the artist below, including details about his age, birthday, blood type, height etc. Then, there would be more information about the member alongside a picture of the member on the left. There would also be albums that they made on their own displayed below: </p>
<a href="Top.html">
<a href="seungri.html">
<a href="dragon.html">
<a href="tae.html">
<a href="dae.html">

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
I used CSS and javascript and HTML in my website. The javascript is used for more complicated tasks like for example making the carousell and gallery etc. It is able to do things like fade and even set a timer, which i find really interesting.
I wanted to implement a slideshow with a timer but i didnt have enough time unfortunately.
I wanted to inplement more albums from the individual members of the group however i didnt have time so the links dont work.

<p>
<em>Home<em>
Go to home page, there youll see a carousell with 4 pictures, "M", "A", "D","E". This is from BigBangs most popular album MADE, hence is featured there so that people would be able to see which the bands most popular album.

Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
